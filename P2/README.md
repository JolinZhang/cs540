reflex agent still need to fix for two ghosts.  


## q2:  
Passed with 5/5  

Question:  
1. minimax choose the best of the worst cases,  
and cannot garuntee that pacman will win the  
game, why we still want to learn about it??  
what is the advantage of using this kind of  
algorithom?>>


## q3:  

very painful debuging process!!! But we made it!!!  

previous Bugs:

1. Mistaken select the wrong start up `depth` and `visitedAgents`  
from `getAction()`. cause cutoff method malfunctioed.

```
index = self.alphaBetaPrune(gameState, AlphaBetaAgent.NEG_INFINITE, AlphaBetaAgent.INFINITE, 0, PACMAN, 0)  

```
changed to: depth =1, visitedAgent = 0 will fixed  

```
index = self.alphaBetaPrune(gameState, AlphaBetaAgent.NEG_INFINITE, AlphaBetaAgent.INFINITE, 1, PACMAN, 0)  

```

## q4:  
### Question q4: 5/5 ###  

We just changed the MIN of the minimax to AVG, everything else should leave  
the same as minimax
